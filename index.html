                        <div class="section2">PRIMITIVES</div>
                        They are the atomic building blocks of Sketchpad—the “what exists” visually. These geometric
                        primitives are first-class citizens of the system—each is an object that can be created, stored,
                        manipulated, and constrained.

                        <div class="section2">CONSTRAINTS</div>
                        Sketchpad introduced the idea that geometric relationships could be formally expressed and
                        enforced. These are relational objects—not visual, but ontologically real within the system.
                        They mediate and govern interactions between primitives.

                        <div class="section2">INSTANCE ADN MASTER FIGURE</div>
                        Sketchpad supports object instancing, a precursor to object-oriented programming. Master Drawing
                        is a reusable figure defined once, and an instance is a scaled, rotated, or translated copy of a
                        master figure. These introduce hierarchical composition—drawings made of reusable parts. This
                        hierarchal structure is essential to modularity and abstraction.

                        Transformations exist as operations but are also definable components in the system.
                        Transformations can be applied to any instance or primitive, and they define a mathematical
                        relationship between coordinate systems.

                        Under the hood, these structures define how things exist and are connected. These are the
                        computational
                        substrates that hold and enforce the existence of all other entities.

                        Sketchpad formalizes geometry through computation. These are abstract entities—they define
                        behavior, not form—but they are necessary to the ontology of the system as a live, interactive
                        model.

                        <div class=" section">Contextual Analysis</div>
                        Most computers in the Sixties were used for batch processing—punch cards submitted to
                        mainframes, results printed hours later. The idea of real-time, graphical interaction with a
                        computer was radical and almost nonexistent in practice. There were no established computer
                        graphics systems. Basic plotting existed, but the idea of drawing with a computer using a
                        pen-like device was revolutionary. CRTs (cathode ray tubes) were being explored for direct
                        visual output, paving the way for visual computing.
                        <br><br>
                        Sutherland sought to demonstrate that computers could support visual thinking, not just
                        numerical calculation. He challenged the notion that computers were only for mathematicians or
                        engineers—he imagined them as tools for designers, architects, engineers, and eventually
                        everyone. Sketchpad was implicitly questioning the role of humans in computing—introducing the
                        idea of human-computer symbiosis (a term popularized by J.C.R. Licklider in 1960).
                        <br><br>
                        Although Sutherland couldn’t have foreseen all future applications, Sketchpad laid the
                        groundwork for CAD softwares, GUI design, video games, virtual and augmented reality. It was the
                        first system to combine graphical interaction, constraints, object instancing, and real-time
                        feedback—the origin point of modern GUI and CAD. Sutherland introduced ideas that would reappear
                        in Object-oriented programming (via master-instance), UX/UI design principles (direct
                        manipulation), and Parametric modeling (via constraints).

                        <div class=" section">Practice and Methodology</div>
                        The methodology underlying Sketchpad is a synthesis of computational geometry, logic-based
                        constraint solving, and interactive interface design. Sutherland’s software approach was
                        fundamentally object-oriented before the term existed — using data structures to define reusable
                        “master” figures and establishing relationships between them via constraints. The system’s
                        architecture was deeply linked to the TX-2 computer’s hardware capabilities, including light pen
                        input and real-time CRT rendering. From a data perspective, Sketchpad treated geometry not as
                        static image but as logical structure — a radical reframing of visual form as a manipulable,
                        rule-based system. The theoretical method was grounded in cybernetics and man–machine symbiosis:
                        the goal was not automation, but augmentation — creating a medium where human intuition and
                        machine precision could interact dynamically. In this study, I used temporal structuring and
                        visual mapping as methodological tools to understand how such computational paradigms evolve,
                        propagate, and fragment into subdomains like CAD, visual programming, and creative coding.

                        <div class=" section">Rhetorical Positioning</div>
                        Sketchpad is not just a technical demonstration; it is a rhetorical act — an argument for a new
                        relationship between humans and computers. By enabling users to draw and manipulate geometry
                        directly, Sutherland challenged the dominant notion of computers as abstract, symbolic
                        processors and reframed them as visual, spatial collaborators. The project asserts that drawing
                        is a form of reasoning, and that logic can be embedded in space — a claim that resonates across
                        architecture, design, and programming. Within Sutherland’s wider practice, Sketchpad marks the
                        beginning of a lifelong inquiry into spatial computation, extended later through his work in 3D
                        graphics and virtual reality. Its influence runs like an invisible thread through nearly every
                        piece of software I use daily — from Rhino, with its precision modeling and NURBS-based
                        geometry, to Blender, with its object instancing and transformable 3D views, to Processing,
                        which echoes Sketchpad’s belief that drawing and logic can coexist in code. Even the
                        fundamentals of drag-and-drop interfaces, layers, and constraint-based layouts in tools like
                        Figma or Adobe Illustrator have roots in the direct manipulation paradigm Sketchpad introduced.
